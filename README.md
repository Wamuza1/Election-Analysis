In this project, we will be assisting Tom in an election audit of the tabulated results for U.S congressional precinct in Colorado. We are performing various tasks with reporting total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. we need to read, process, and parse, or analyze, the data in the file. Three primary voting counting methods Tom and we will take into account:
- Mail in Ballots
- Punch cards
- Direct recording electronic(DRE)
Above three methods determine the final election results, and based on these results we will be generating a vote count report to certify the U.S congressional race.
